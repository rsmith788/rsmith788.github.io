				This is for those folks are destined for something more. I speak to all of you.
				Consider me your coach, im gonna help you make a fortune, Im going to turn you into a  person who can turn thyself into a machine.

				But you best hurry  up and sign up quick! spots are fillin up ! We only take on 500 clients a month. Last Month 
				we had something like 2000 sign up in the matter of a couple of days. 2000-500=1500  people who signed up too late. Buttttt If you sign up early, you have the chance to make the cut, but 
				to stay with uncle tommy you must be be competitive, with fierce determination. 

				Now imagine you went to some bullshit therapy place. Those are the type of places that have some
				type of agenda. An agenda to conform to society and all of its averageness.

				Theres  a  different type  of feeling you get walking down the  street in the  morning after pulling an All
				nighter working. You put on some larry june or curren$y and you walk down  the  sidewalk like "yea" You  know what Im sayin?

				you probably don't know what I'm sayin. You are not like me. Atleast not yet. Look, this is  not black and white, I'm not telling
				you all of therapy is bullshit. Believe it or not journaling actually doesn't make you gay. Its good to do it, so you
				can make  sure you are approaching every situation logically. My problem is with the soft ass therapy these days. And  I'm going to
				prove it you. I have hard evidence that support my claims. 

				Not only will I be  proving their way is wrong, Im gonna reveal some highly classified information about my Uncle Tommy.
				If you sign up you have the privlige of learning something.
