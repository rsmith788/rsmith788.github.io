		  Attention:
		  Do you feel you are destined for a greater life, but feel overwhelmed by the obstacles in front of
		  you?
		  Have you ever felt like talking out your problems to a therapist but didn’t because you thought
		  therapists are for pussies?
		  Are you ready to build the strength, wisdom, and resilience to become a “somebody”?
		  Well, the cold hard truth is right now, you are not a “somebody”, the fact you are still reading
		  this, looking for a therapist, signals weakness. Thankfully for you, we do not look down on the
		  weak, we believe in shepherding in the weak, turning them into strong men.
		  Our goal is to mold you into someone who is strong enough to no longer need assistance from a
		  shrink.
