			Do you feel you are destined for a greater life, but feel overwhelmed by the obstacles in front of you?
			Have you ever felt like talking out your problems to a therapist but didn’t because you thought therapists are for pussies?
			Are you ready to build the strength, wisdom, and resilience to become a “somebody”?
		</p>
		<p>
			Well, the cold hard truth is right now, you are not a “somebody”, the fact you are still reading this, looking for a therapist, signals weakness. Thankfully for you, we do not look down on the weak, we believe in shepherding in the weak, turning them into strong men.

		</p>
		<p>Our goal is to mold you into someone who is strong enough to no longer need assistance from a shrink.   </p>
