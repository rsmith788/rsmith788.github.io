<p>404 Page Not Found Kate Wagner describes her nostalgia to the �old internet�, the pre 2010s internet.
She reminisces of being a young child and watching web aesthetics evolve over time. 
Throughout the essay there are quotes from Karl Marx, and a radical stance against capitalism, Wagner uses the quote �capitalism will obliterate everything you know and love� 
She is very direct and clear when expressing where she stands. 
Greedy corporations only care about website aesthetics having a look that rivals its competitors.</p>

<p>Wagner picked apart facebook, explaining how their approach, how they began as an interface used only by ivy league schools. 
Thus allowing them an appearance of upper class internet. This is part of what killed websites such as myspace. 
As someone born in 2001, I remember some of the referenced websites, I remember that aesthetic of random websites from 2010-14, when the old internet was in its ending years.
I found it interesting to hear more about myspace, as I've always heard it  referenced but I do not know too much about the site itself.</p>

<p>Wagner talks about how all of these sites end up getting wiped out. I agree, I can�t recall the last time I saw any of the old internet aesthetic.
I love the title page, the image on the front page captures exactly what this article is about. The cover gets you on her side from the beginning, seeing how visually appealing it is. 
Throughout the article, it is clear this is a rant. A rant about capitalism, A rant about the lack of creativity, A rant about the very nature of time. 
She mentions that corporations like instagram know that nostalgia sells so they will bring back back internet trends, but not with good intentions.</p>

<p>Despite seeming hopeless throughout the article, towards the end in the passage titled �revenge of the old internet� she relishes in the downfall of facebook, mentioning how 44% of people aged 18-29 have deleted the app.
How the app has become a place for �racist boomers" to pollute the world with their stupidity and help someone like Donald Trump get elected. 
While I don't disagree, I don�t think that facebook should be punished for allowing people to connect with likeminded people, as in many instances it leads to great things, the equation of how Donald Trump was elected contains many more variables than just facebook. 
Wagner paints a very vivid image of what the internet looked like back then and translates her emotions authentically. 
So it becomes clear that she is a hater of the new internet, this mixed in with a little bit of radical ideology, communism, makes this article a thrilling read. </p>

<p>While I don�t share her pessimistic spirit, I, like her, want an 'old website resurgence' to occur, but, with all the new technology that exists today, we can combine that with creativity and have it be an even better web. 
A more abstract, creative web, than it was all those years ago. Maybe I am naive to think this way. 
Maybe the capitalists always win, but there's gotta be a corporation that believes in true creativity, that they can make a ton of money prioritizing people's creativity as well as being a �psychologically appealing� option the way facebook was back in its rise.</p>
